# Frequently Asked Questions

## No Hitsounds?
Please read [Audio Setup](setup/audio.md#editor-hitsounds).

## I selected an audio/image file, but it didn't load.
Please read [Working with Filepaths in SATURN EDIT](guides/working_with_filepaths.md).

## I closed all my custom layout tabs. How can I get them back?
You can add new Tool Windows by navigating to this location:
```
View | Tool Windows | ...
```

Or apply one of the layout presets here:
```
View | Layout Presets | ...
```

## This Editor looks very different to older Editors I'm used to. How do I do X now?
Please read the [Transition Guide](guides/transition_guide.md).

## How do I change the Tempo/Metre?
Please read [Chart Setup - Tempo and Metre](setup/chart.md#tempo-and-metre).

## I opened a file and there's no Notes/Metronome/Measure Lines?
Your Chart probably doesn't have a defined Layer.
This may happen when importing a file with an old Chart Format that does not have any defined Notes or Layer-bound Events.

You can add a new Layer in the [Layer List Tool Window](tool-windows/layer_list.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you can't find a Tool Window titled "Layer List", you can open a new one here:
> ```
> View | Tool Windows | Layer List
