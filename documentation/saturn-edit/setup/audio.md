# Audio Setup
All audio setup is done in the Volume Mixer. You can find it on the right side of the top menu bar by clicking <img src="media/volume.png" width="20">.

## Volume
Volume of all audio channels can be individually adjusted with the corresponding slider.  
The slider labeled `Master` acts as a volume multiplier for all audio channels.     
The slider labeled `Hitsounds` acts as a volume multiplier for every hitsound audio channel.  

## Hitsounds
SATURN EDIT currently does not have built-in hitsounds. You must source hitsound audio yourself, and select in manually in the Volume Mixer.

To pick a file for a specific hitsound, press <img src="media/pickfile.png" width="20">. Your selection is automatically saved and loaded. There is no need to restart the editor for changes to take effect.
